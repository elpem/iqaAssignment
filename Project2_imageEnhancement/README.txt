Here are the MATLAB scripts used in my assignment.

myImplementation.m shows the implementation of my algorithm and uses it with a simple Salt and Pepper noise exemple (Assignment, Part.II).

compareTwoImplementations.m was used to compare my implementation with the pre-implemented Median Filtering (Assignment, Part.III).

analyzeMedianFilter.m was used to perform Median Filter on the Tampere Image Database (TID) (Assignment, Part.IV).

-----------------
Because the TID is way to big, we kept one image. So analyseMedianFilter.m doesn't work. To have it working, just download the TID and put it in your currentfolder.
